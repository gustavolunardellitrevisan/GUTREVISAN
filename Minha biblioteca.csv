Feedback in the academic community to these guidelines was diverse. Some were concerned researchers could use our guidelines to manipulate rankings of scientific articles and promote what we call 'academic search engine spam'. To find out whether these concerns are justified, we conducted several tests on Google Scholar. The results show that academic search engine spam is indeed-and with little effort-possible: We increased rankings of academic articles on Google Scholar by manipulating their citation counts; Google Scholar indexed invisible text we added to some articles, making papers appear for keyword searches the articles were not relevant for; Google Scholar indexed some nonsensical articles we randomly created with the paper generator SciGen; and Google Scholar linked to manipulated versions of research papers that contained a Viagra advertisement. At the end of this paper, we discuss whether academic search engine spam could become a serious threat to Web-based academic search engines.","2010","2020-07-30 19:41:26","2020-07-31 00:46:11","","","","3","13","","J.

These systems allow users to organize, manage and search the required resource freely, thus by combination and integration of recommendation systems in social software, assisting users to appropriately assign tag to resources and try to improve annotation among users. The challenges of recommendation systems are large-scale data, inconsistence data, usage of time-consuming machine learning algorithms, long and unreasonable time of recommendation and not being scalable to the demands of real world applications. Recently more efforts have been conducted to solve these problems. In this paper we proposed a tag recommendation system that is able to work with large-scale data and being applied in real world.

One year later, we have about 2,888 visits per day, where only 2% of them are from Guatemala and the other 98% from other countries around the world.

They can enhance an article's visibility, link one's research rapidly to the appropriate web of key literature, and bring it to the attention of more scholars who will use it, thus boosting the chances of maximized citation hits. Yet writing an article for online distribution in a way that takes advantage of these benefits is different from preparing one for print journals in some small, but important, respects. To be cited, articles have to be both visible in an electronic environment and perceptively relevant to their key audience from the outset. After introducing the first online-only issue of Politics & Policy (a print-driven journal for 40 years), the editor covers some techniques authors should consider when submitting to online journals, from writing a search engine-friendly title and abstract to tips on how authors can maximize visibility once an article is published. © The Policy Studies Organization.","2012","2020-07-30 19:41:27","2020-07-30 19:41:27","","1-12","","1","40","","Polit.

Google Scholar makes specific recommendations for repositories, including the use of publishing industry metadata schemas over Dublin Core. This paper aims to test a theory that transforming metadata schemas in institutional repositories will lead to increased indexing by Google Scholar. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted two surveys of institutional and disciplinary repositories across the USA, using different methodologies. They also conducted three pilot projects that transformed the metadata of a subset of papers from USpace, the University of Utah's institutional repository, and examined the results of Google Scholar's explicit harvests. Findings: Repositories that use GS recommended metadata schemas and express them in HTML meta tags experienced significantly higher indexing ratios. The ease with which search engine crawlers can navigate a repository also seems to affect indexing ratio. The second and third metadata transformation pilot projects at Utah were successful, ultimately achieving an indexing ratio of greater than 90 percent. Research limitations/implications: The second survey is limited to 40 titles from each of seven repositories, for a total of 280 titles. A larger survey that covers more repositories may be useful. Practical implications: Institutional repositories are achieving significant mass, and the rate of author citations from those repositories may affect university rankings. Lack of visibility in Google Scholar, however, will limit the ability of IRs to play a more significant role in those citation rates. Social implications: Transforming metadata can be a difficult and tedious process. The Institute of Museum and Library Services has recently awarded a National Leadership Grant to the University of Utah to continue SEO research with its partner, OCLC Inc., and to develop a toolkit that will include automated transformation mechanisms. Originality/value: Little or no research has been published about improving the indexing ratio of institutional repositories in Google Scholar. The authors believe that they are the first to address the possibility of transforming IR metadata to improve indexing ratios in Google Scholar. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","2012","2020-07-30 19:41:27","2020-07-30 19:41:27","","60-81","","1","30","","Libr.

Then, we always need a system which can find suitable information in short time within vast of data. Recommendation systems are solution of this problem. Recommendation systems by using Data Mining technique can provide appropriate offers and choose prominent information from among large of data. When the user logged for first time his/her profile is null which is critical problem in these systems, so by using approach based on collaboration any similar user for this user is not found which represent Cold-Start problem.In this issue we proposed tag based on resource recommendation system which can help to user in select suitable resources. In this system offers to user based on user's personal interests, interests of similar users, content resources, databases which associated with ontology and related words. The present method resolved Cold-Start problem in the beginning executes system by combined and integrated methods based on content, collaboration, related words and user profile that means it is greatest advantage of present system rather than previous systems. The proposed system's evaluation performed on a dataset collected from Delicious.com. Evaluation results of proposed method illustrate this method general quality of recommendations that has been improved. © 2012 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","2012","2020-07-30 19:41:28","2020-07-30 19:41:28","","2062-2069","","5","7","","Int.

In this paper, starting with a general discussion on the many facets of optimization in information technology (IT), we focus our examination on the recent development in database keyword search, from an optimization-oriented perspective. We first present a review and analysis on related literature, pointing out the need for incorporating contextual information in database keyword queries to achieve better performance. We then present our recently proposed approach, where keyword search is extended to simple English queries to better capture user intension.

They have a profound impact on the way knowledge is generated, transmitted, and distributed. This chapter first explores how Google Scholar works as a human-technological system in order to analyze the site's technology in combination with its inscribed usage and its actual use and users. The chapter then scrutinize the complex power relationships of digital networks with Google at its epicenter. Following Manuel Castells's (2009) proposal to ""unwire"" the construction of academic knowledge through the coded dynamics of search engines, the author examines the larger legal and political-economic implications of the platform's architecture and organized structure. Combining these two layers of analysis should inform an enriched type of information literacy. © 2013, IGI Global.","2012","2020-07-30 19:41:28","2020-07-30 19:41:28","","130-146","","","","","","","","","","","IGI Global","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Social Software and the Evol. of User Expertise: Fut.

Here each observation is a Poisson random variable whose mean is a sparse linear superposition of known patterns. Unlike many conventional problems observations here are not identically distributed since they are associated with different sensing modalities. We analyse the performance of a Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoder, which for our Poisson setting is computationally tractable. We derive fundamental sample complexity bounds for sparse recovery in the high-dimensional setting. We show that when the sensing matrix satisfies the socalled Restricted Eigenvalue (RE) condition the ℓ1 regularized ML decoder is consistent. Moreover, it converges exponentially fast in terms of number of observations. Our results apply to both deterministic and random sensing matrices and we present several results for both cases. © 2013 IEEE.","2013","2020-07-30 19:41:28","2020-07-30 19:41:28","2013-10-02","1450-1457","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Computer Society","Monticello, IL","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Annu.

Traditional Western databases suggest that English-language scholarship on both film and novel (on which the film is based) is very sparse. But Google Scholar, as well as Chinese databases suggest another story altogether. The discrepancy suggests a problematic disconnect between Western and Chinese scholarship, even within the work of a single scholar. Harvard academic Ou-fan Lee has written an English article on Ang Lee's film adaptation of the novel, but has also published a monograph (Oxford University Press, Hong Kong) on the same topic in Chinese. Why has Ou-fan Lee, working in both Chinese and English, chosen to publish his monograph in Chinese only? Why has his monograph not been translated into English? If strong nationalist attitudes make Chinese humanities scholars resistant to writing in English, a preference for Orientalist discourses on the part of western journals makes it difficult for Western scholars to access a plethora of Chinese material that falls outside of this discourse and is therefore not translated into English (Flowerdew & Li). Is this the case with Ou-fan's monograph? What are the differences between Ou-fan's English article and his Chinese text? My investigation contributes to an only recentlydeveloping, long-overdue intercourse between English and Chinese-speaking scholars in 21st-century humanities. © Common Ground, Authors, All Rights Reserved.","2013","2020-07-30 19:41:28","2020-07-30 19:41:28","","95-103","","2","10","","Int.

The relative novelty of its occurrence in a business context, the lack of well-grounded best practice and the scarcity of research, result in organizational decision-makers having to rely on vendor descriptions and trade press articles to make sense of social media. By using management fashion theory and discourse analysis, we examine how a management fashion discourse on social media unfolds and enacts social media as a disruptive force that managers must consider in the form of e.g. strategies, normative guidelines and policies. Our analysis shows that social media discourse differs somewhat from how previous IT fashions have developed, primarily due to the fact that social media discourse is propelled by forces outside the company. We analyze the discourse constructs identified in the data using management fashion theory and position social media discourse as a particular form of management fashion. The 'problem discourse' defines hinders towards strategic development of social media and the reasons for their existence, which provides an agenda for change. The 'solution discourse' theorizes social media as a business case and provides arguments for how managers should organize internally to meet the new demands. The 'bandwagon discourse' provides role models, policies and codes of conduct for a successful dissemination of social media into the organization.","2013","2020-07-30 19:41:28","2020-07-30 19:41:28","2013-06-05","","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Information Systems","Utrecht","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: ECIS - Proc.

Design/methodology/approach: The study applies web analytical tools, such as Alexa.com, in the collection of data about Canadian libraries' visibility performance in the ranking of search engine results. Concepts from the Integrated IS&R Research Framework are applied to analyze SEO as an element within the Framework. Findings: The results show that certain websites' characteristics do have an effect on how well libraries' websites are ranked by search engines. Notably, the reputation of a library's website and the number of its search engine indexed webpages increase its ranking on SERPs as well as the findability of its digital content. Originality/value: Most of the existing works on SEO have been confined to popular literature, outside of scholarly academic research in library and information science. Only few studies with a focus on libraries' application of SEO exist. No known study has applied an empirical approach to the examination of relevant libraries' website characteristics to determine their visibility performance on search engine result pages (SERPs). This study identified several website characteristics that can be optimized for higher SERP rankings. It also analyzed the impact of external links, as well as that of the number of indexed webpages by search engines on higher SERP rankings. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","2013","2020-07-30 19:41:29","2020-07-30 19:41:29","","87-108","","1","31","","Libr.

The main argument of the paper is that, paradoxically, in an age when the availability of information has increased exponentially, there is a risk that diversity in the use of sources for the construction of knowledge becomes more restricted than in the past and that information search moves towards greater objectification and centralisation. Knowledge management systems increasingly shape the ways in which we think about the questions we ask and how we try to answer them, which raises fundamental and largely neglected questions for education policy. The paper illustrates these trends with particular reference to the use of Google and Google Scholar. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","2013","2020-07-30 19:41:29","2020-07-30 19:41:29","","481-500","","4","28","","J.

For our students and for communities with whom we work, the world exists to be recorded, shared, and distributed: social media is testament to this documentary Zeitgeist. How do we take a community's interest in these tools and forge a partnership that is both socially beneficial and rigorous? While the tools and the desire to undertake multimedia anthropology have never been so readily available, both the guidelines for multimedia research and the structure for the more fluid relationships between communities, participants, researchers, and universities are lacking. This paper will look to Anthropology by the Wire for a new model of public anthropology premised on social activism and collaborative research. In this ""networked anthropology,"" the onus is on anthropologists to create their own ""recursive"" publics. This in turn is a form of reflexivity that, in an age of social media, comprises a vital stage in the collaborative ethnographic process.","2013","2020-07-30 19:41:29","2020-07-30 19:41:29","","358-368","","4","72","","Hum.

In this contribution we highlight two concerns that the research community needs to pay attention to. One, in the world of search engine facilitated research, factors such as ease of Web discovery, ease of access, and content relevance, rather than quality, influence what gets read and cited. Two, research evaluation based on citation counts works against many types of high-quality works. We also elaborate on the implications of these points by examining a recent nationwide evaluation of researchers performed in Italy. We focus on our discipline (computer science), but we believe that our observations have relevance for a broad audience. © 2014, Published with license by Taylor & Francis.","2014","2020-07-30 19:41:29","2020-07-30 19:41:29","","349-354","","5","30","","Inf.

So far, academic research on organisational practice of social media is sporadic and corporate actors are thus left without level-headed advice as to how to best implement and use social media technologies. In this paper, we examine what sort of advice management consultants offer organisations looking to engage in social media. We use four affordances of social media - visibility, persistence, editability, and association - to analytically explore the fit between social media as a technology and the strategies offered by consultancy firms. We also look attitudes towards social media and information management, which contributes to practitioners' understanding of the intrinsic characteristics of social media. Our research concludes that affordances of the technology clashes with a centralised top-down approach to information management that dominates in consultants' strategy documents.","2014","2020-07-30 19:41:29","2020-07-30 19:41:29","2014-08-07","","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Information Systems","Savannah, GA","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Amer.

As search engines are the mostused service on the Internet, their importance cannot be underestimated. The power of search engines results from search engine providers' decisions on what users get to see on the results pages, including decisions on the results' positions and their display. There are many steps within the searching process where the design of the search engine can influence a user's decision for or against a certain result. Taken together with external influences of search results (e. g., through search engine optimization), users are guided towards certain results and results types, as well. This article considers the influence the design of search engines and the (assumed) intent of the search engine providers have on users' decisions within the searching process. Possible solutions for gaining more influence on the users' side are shown, but also their limitations.","2014","2020-07-30 19:41:30","2020-07-30 19:41:30","","231-238","","4-5","65","","Inf.-Wiss.

Design/methodology/approach - The total number of records and those belonging to the most reputable journals (1,762) and organizations (346) according to the Field Rating indicator in each of the 15 fields and 204 sub-fields of MAS, have been collected and statistically analysed in March 2014, by means of an automated querying process via http, covering academic publications from 1700 to present. Findings - MAS has no longer been updated since 2013, although this phenomenon began to be glimpsed in 2011, when its coverage plummeted. Throughout 2014, indexing of new records is still ongoing, but at a minimum rate, without following any apparent pattern. Research limitations/implications - There are also retrospective records being indexed at present. In this sense, this research provides a picture of what MAS offered during March 2014 being queried directly via http. Practical implications - The unnoticed obsolescence of MAS affects to the quality of the service offered to its users (both those who engage in scientific information seeking and also those who use it for quantitative purposes). Social implications - The predominance of Google Scholar (GS) as monopoly in the academic search engines market as well as the prevalence of an open construction model (GS) vs a closed model (MAS). Originality/value - A complete longitudinal analysis of disciplines, journals and organizations on MAS has been performed for the first time identifying an unnoticed obsolescence. Any public explanation or disclaimer note has been announced from the responsible company, something incomprehensible given its implications for the reliability and validity of bibliometric data provided on disciplines, journals, authors and congress as well as their fair representation on the academic search engine. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","2014","2020-07-30 19:41:30","2020-07-30 19:41:30","","936-953","","7","38","","Online Info.

Its promises of free, universal, and easy access to scientific literature coupled with the perception that it covers the social sciences and the humanities better than other traditional multidisciplinary databases have contributed to the quick expansion of Google Scholar Citations and Google Scholar Metrics: 2 new bibliometric products that offer citation data at the individual level and at journal level. In this article, we show the results of an experiment undertaken to analyze Google Scholar's capacity to detect citation-counting manipulation. For this, we uploaded 6 documents to an institutional web domain that were authored by a fictitious researcher and referenced all the publications of the members of the EC3 research group at the University of Granada. The detection by Google Scholar of these papers caused an outburst in the number of citations included in the Google Scholar Citations profiles of the authors. We discuss the effects of such an outburst and how it could affect the future development of such products, at both the individual level and the journal level, especially if Google Scholar persists with its lack of transparency. © 2014 ASIS&T.","2014","2020-07-30 19:41:30","2020-07-30 19:41:30","","446-454","","3","65","","J.

Currently, Europe revives the ""right to erasure"" as a first step towards a forgetting web. Early technologies implementing oblivion suffer from vulnerabilities and narrowly assume that users require information to be erased after a pre-determined time. But little is known about users' actual oblivion needs. A first study shows that users desire control over disclosed personal information to reduce pre-disclosure privacy concerns, and to delete harmful information after disclosure. In the long run, users have a need for dissociating from obsolete information that represents their past identity. A second study analyses whether oblivion-enhancing technologies (OETs) currently deployed in online services satisfy users' needs. While not all services give users assurance that disclosed information can be erased again, most provide users with some active control. But to manage the increasing volume of personal information stored, users would also require ""intelligent"" support with oblivion. Intelligent agents that keep track of disclosed information long-term could automatically safeguard users from information relating to a past episode in life surfacing unexpectedly.","2014","2020-07-30 19:41:30","2020-07-30 19:41:30","2014-06-09","","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Information Systems","Tel Aviv","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: ECIS Proc. - Eur.

A 3-step matrix based herbal bioprospection approach was devised to identify potential herbal leads targeting process of spread of micro-organism in the host cell. 05 bioactivity parameters were selected on the basis of extensive literature surge relevant to confer multi-drug resistance among P. aeruginosa. Biofilm formation and Quorum sensing exhibited maximum relevance as physiological targets. The binary matrix score analysis of database of 38 plants identified using classical bioprospection filtered 10 herbal exhibi ted potential to mitigate =3 virulence factors. The weightage matrix score analysis excluded 05 herbals having score less than median weightage matrix score i.e., 12.66. The optimization of bioassociational data on a scale of 0-1 using fuzzy score matrix analysis led to the selection of Glycyrrhiza glabra (Gg), Terminalia chebula (Tc), Aloe barbadensis (Ab) and Mentha piperita (Mp) as potent herbal leads with μS > 0.5 (~median fuzzy score) and Zingiber officinale (Zo) selected as control lead molecule. These herbal leads will be subjected to in vitro analysis in future studies.","2014","2020-07-30 19:41:30","2020-07-30 19:41:30","","163-176","","2","2","","J. Interdiscip. Multidiscip.

However, even today's best software-based systems can only reliably identify copy & paste plagiarism. Disguised plagiarism forms, including paraphrased text, cross-language plagiarism, as well as structural and idea plagiarism often remain undetected. This weakness of current systems results in a large percentage of scientific plagiarism going undetected. Bela Gipp provides an overview of the state-of-the art in plagiarism detection and an analysis of why these approaches fail to detect disguised plagiarism forms. The author proposes Citation-based Plagiarism Detection to address this shortcoming. Unlike character-based approaches, this approach does not rely on text comparisons alone, but analyzes citation patterns within documents to form a language-independent ""semantic fingerprint"" for similarity assessment. The practicability of Citation-based Plagiarism Detection was proven by its capability to identify so-far non-machine detectable plagiarism in scientific publications. © Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden 2014.

In this paper, we describe a method of supporting scholarly surveys by incorporating a graph based on citation relationships into the results page of an academic search engine. Conventional academic search engines have a problem in that users have difficulty in determining which academic papers are relevant to their needs because it is hard to understand the relationship between the academic papers that appear in the search results pages. Our method helps users to make judgments about the relevance of papers by clearly visualizing the relationship. It visualizes not only academic papers on the results page but also papers that have a strong citation relationship with them. We carefully considered the method of visualization and implemented a prototype with which we conducted a user study simulating scholarly surveys. We confirmed that our method improved the efficiency of scholarly surveys through the user study. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","2015","2020-07-30 19:41:31","2020-07-30 19:41:31","2015-12-02","","56","","9460","","","","11th Asia Information Retrieval Societies Conference, AIRS 2015","","","","Springer Verlag","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

Inquiry into differences among open access sources referenced between 2005 and 2014 revealed that non-indexed journals were being used notably fewer times than their commercially indexed counterparts. A comparison of HTML source code between indexed and non-indexed journals illustrated that certain metadata and other coding features may have affected the visibility of non-indexed journal content. The study suggests to librarians the presence of less visible empirical literature on the web and to smaller, independent academic publishers, the need to apply better quality metadata and optimization strategies to their open access journal content. © 2015, Published with license by Taylor & Francis.","2015","2020-07-30 19:41:31","2020-07-30 19:41:31","","65-84","","2-3","9","","J.

Similar discussions happen on the interpretation of social scientific research data, for which information triangulation has been proposed as a useful method. In this article, we explore a design theory - consisting of a kernel theory, meta-requirements, and meta-designs - for software and services that triangulate Internet information. The kernel theory identifies 5 triangulation methods based on Churchman's inquiring systems theory and related meta-requirements. These meta-requirements are used to search for existing software and services that contain design features for Internet information triangulation tools. We discuss a prototyping study of the use of an information triangulator among 72 college students and how their use contributes to their opinion formation. From these findings, we conclude that triangulation tools can contribute to opinion formation by information consumers, especially when the tool is not a mere fact checker but includes the search and delivery of alternative views. Finally, we discuss other empirical propositions and design propositions for an agenda for triangulator developers and researchers. In particular, we propose investment in theory triangulation, that is, tools to automatically detect ethically and theoretically alternative information and views. © 2014 ASIS&T.","2015","2020-07-30 19:41:31","2020-07-31 00:44:08","","684-701","","4","66","","J.

They have a profound impact on the way knowledge is generated, transmitted, and distributed. This chapter first explores how Google Scholar works as a human-technological system in order to analyze the site's technology in combination with its inscribed usage and its actual use and users. The chapter then scrutinize the complex power relationships of digital networks with Google at its epicenter. Following Manuel Castells's (2009) proposal to ""unwire"" the construction of academic knowledge through the coded dynamics of search engines, the author examines the larger legal and political-economic implications of the platform's architecture and organized structure. Combining these two layers of analysis should inform an enriched type of information literacy. © 2016 by IGI Global.

Some of these datasets are available as Linked Data which has great potential for future research or commercial exploitation. Yet, search engines are struggling to index statistical Linked Data and therefore, normal web users have difficulties to access it. In this paper, we present the approach SEO4OLAP, which generates search engine optimized webpages for every possible view on statistical datasets. Statistical datasets are usually based on a Multidimensional Model (MDM) and can therefore be queried by means of Online Analytical Processing (OLAP). We present a new OLAP query model which allows queries to be represented by clean URIs. We also present a mathematical model to compute the overall number of possible views of a dataset. We evaluate our approach by publishing two datasets from Eurostat with our SEO4OLAP system. We observe that our webpages are indexed by search engines and conclude that the system can have benefits for data publishers, web users and search engine providers.","2016","2020-07-30 19:41:32","2020-07-30 19:41:32","2016-09-26","395-407","","","P-259","","","","","","","","Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI)","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

These metrics have become important for research institutions and other stakeholders to support impactful decision making processes such as hiring or funding decisions. However, scientific Web repositories typically offer only simple performance metrics and limited analysis options. Moreover, the data and algorithms to compute performance metrics are usually not published. Hence, it is not transparent or verifiable which publications the systems include in the computation and how the systems rank the results. Many researchers are interested in accessing the underlying scientometric raw data to increase the transparency of these systems. In this paper, we discuss the challenges and present strategies to programmatically access such data in scientific Web repositories. We demonstrate the strategies as part of an open source tool (MIT license) that allows research performance comparisons based on Google Scholar data. We would like to emphasize that the scraper included in the tool should only be used if consent was given by the operator of a repository. In our experience, consent is often given if the research goals are clearly explained and the project is of a non-commercial nature.","2016","2020-07-30 19:41:32","2020-07-30 19:41:32","","","","9-10","22","","D-Lib Mag.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Corporation for National Research Initiatives","<p>Cited By :4</p>; <p>Export Date: 30 July 2020</p>; <p>References: Balla, A., Stassopoulou, A., Dikaiakos, M.D., Real-time Web Crawler Detection (2011) Proc. 18th Int.

To do this, a query per year was carried out from 1950 to 2013 identifying the top 1,000 documents retrieved from Google Scholar and obtaining a final sample of 64,000 documents, of which 40% provided a free link to full-text. The results obtained show that the average highly-cited document is a journal or book article (62% of the top 1% most cited documents of the sample), written in English (92.5% of all documents) and available online in PDF format (86.0% of all documents). Yet, the existence of errors should be noted, especially when detecting duplicates and linking citations properly. Nonetheless, the fact that the study focused on highly cited papers minimizes the effects of these limitations. Given the high presence of books and, to a lesser extent, of other document types (such as proceedings or reports), the present research concludes that the Google Scholar data offer an original and different vision of the most influential academic documents (measured from the perspective of their citation count), a set composed not only of strictly scientific material (journal articles) but also of academic material in its broadest sense. © 2016 CSIC.

The article concludes that these artefacts and strategies are providing a wide set of ‘active’ social actors with new resources in, and arenas for, their struggles for economic as well as social advancement, processes of self-monitoring and also, crucially, of self-formation. The article focuses on the interplay and tensions between governments and bureaucracies, private companies, education institutions, and various types of ‘active’ individuals (the individual customer, the individual manager and the individual worker) in the process of surveillance and recreation of education through digital data. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","2016","2020-07-30 19:41:32","2020-07-30 19:41:32","","14-33","","1","15","","Eur.

The results reveal that, on average, more author-assigned keywords and more cataloger-assigned Library of Congress Subject Headings were assigned to works emerging from the arts & humanities than to works emerging from the social sciences and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. STEM disciplines in particular received a lower amount of topical metadata, in part because of the under-assignment of name/title, geographical, and corporate subject headings. These findings reveal how librarians could increase their understanding of how topical access is functioning within academic disciplines. © 2016, Published with license by Taylor & Francis.","2016","2020-07-30 19:41:32","2020-07-30 19:41:32","","213-243","","4","54","","Cat.

The framework provides ICT skills profiles which can be a valuable resource that supports the career planning of a student. However, currently a student does not have a method or approach to exploit the SFIA framework to align his or her competencies that he or she has acquired during the education program, to the skills defined in the SFIA framework. In this paper, we present a solution model for generating a skills report based on individual's competencies and experiences. In particular, we focus on Information Systems students' profiles. Student skill generator takes in curriculum and LinkedIn profile's data as an input and generates student's skills report which is aligned with SFIA framework. Moreover, the system also generates a list of recommended jobs in ICT sector that match the student's skills. We evaluated our solution model on an undergraduate core curriculum; Bachelor of Science (Information Systems Management) degree program BSc (ISM), offered by the School of Information Systems (SIS), Singapore Management University (SMU) and LinkedIn profiles of student from year 3, year 4 and alumni. © 2016 IEEE.","2016","2020-07-30 19:41:32","2020-07-30 19:41:32","2016-04-10","248-253","","","10-13-April-2016","","","","","","","","IEEE Computer Society","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Global Eng.

We model each observation as a Poisson random variable whose mean is a sparse linear superposition of known patterns. Unlike many conventional problems observations here are not identically distributed since they are associated with different sensing modalities. We analyze the performance of a maximum likelihood (ML) decoder, which for our Poisson setting involves a non-linear optimization but yet is computationally tractable. We derive fundamental sample complexity bounds for sparse recovery when the measurements are contaminated with Poisson noise. In contrast to the least-squares linear regression setting with Gaussian noise, we observe that in addition to sparsity, the scale of the parameters also fundamentally impacts $\ell-2$ error in the Poisson setting. We show that our upper bounds are tight under suitable regularity conditions. Specifically, we derive a minimax matching lower bound on the mean-squared error and show that our constrained ML decoder is minimax optimal for this regime. © 1991-2012 IEEE.","2016","2020-07-30 19:41:33","2020-07-30 19:41:33","","3495-3508","","13","64","","IEEE Trans Signal Process","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","<p>Cited By :6</p>; <p>CODEN: ITPRE</p>; <p>Export Date: 30 July 2020</p>; <p>References: Stringer, R.C., Gangopadhyay, S., Grant, S.A., Detection of nitroaromatic explosives using a fluorescent-labeled imprinted polymer (2010) Analytic.

We reviewed these articles and present some descriptive statistics in this paper, as well as a discussion about the major advancements and shortcomings and an overview of the most common recommendation concepts and approaches. We found that more than half of the recommendation approaches applied content-based filtering (55 %). Collaborative filtering was applied by only 18 % of the reviewed approaches, and graph-based recommendations by 16 %. Other recommendation concepts included stereotyping, item-centric recommendations, and hybrid recommendations. The content-based filtering approaches mainly utilized papers that the users had authored, tagged, browsed, or downloaded. TF-IDF was the most frequently applied weighting scheme. In addition to simple terms, n-grams, topics, and citations were utilized to model users’ information needs. Our review revealed some shortcomings of the current research. First, it remains unclear which recommendation concepts and approaches are the most promising. For instance, researchers reported different results on the performance of content-based and collaborative filtering. Sometimes content-based filtering performed better than collaborative filtering and sometimes it performed worse. We identified three potential reasons for the ambiguity of the results. (A) Several evaluations had limitations. They were based on strongly pruned datasets, few participants in user studies, or did not use appropriate baselines. (B) Some authors provided little information about their algorithms, which makes it difficult to re-implement the approaches. Consequently, researchers use different implementations of the same recommendations approaches, which might lead to variations in the results. (C) We speculated that minor variations in datasets, algorithms, or user populations inevitably lead to strong variations in the performance of the approaches. Hence, finding the most promising approaches is a challenge. As a second limitation, we noted that many authors neglected to take into account factors other than accuracy, for example overall user satisfaction. In addition, most approaches (81 %) neglected the user-modeling process and did not infer information automatically but let users provide keywords, text snippets, or a single paper as input. Information on runtime was provided for 10 % of the approaches. Finally, few research papers had an impact on research-paper recommender systems in practice. We also identified a lack of authority and long-term research interest in the field: 73 % of the authors published no more than one paper on research-paper recommender systems, and there was little cooperation among different co-author groups. We concluded that several actions could improve the research landscape: developing a common evaluation framework, agreement on the information to include in research papers, a stronger focus on non-accuracy aspects and user modeling, a platform for researchers to exchange information, and an open-source framework that bundles the available recommendation approaches. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","2016","2020-07-30 19:41:33","2020-07-31 00:44:55","","305-338","","4","17","","Int.

However, its algorithms use an exact keyword match that excludes synonymous search terms that may be overlooked or neglected by researchers. This paper aims to improve on the current Google Scholar Search System by allowing a broad topic search algorithm to diversify and allow synonymous search terms to be included and ranked with other results. The authors propose a Design Science method to improve the Google Scholar Search System by developing a broad topic prototype that will add synonymous keywords into Google Scholar ranking algorithms. The results from twenty users will be evaluated by means of Mean Reciprocal Rank and Discounted Cumulative Gain. This improvement will introduce a modern approach to academic search engines systems, and to allow researchers who overlook potential search queries, an improved core topic diversity, quality, and discoverability of published research. © 2017 AIS/ICIS Administrative Office.

Nosocomial infections caused by ESKAPE pathogens have a high prevalence rate of 3.0-20.7% and an incidence rate of 5-10% globally, contributing to increased morbidity and mortality which has added noticeably to economic burden. Moreover, the chemotherapeutic modalities available for the management of ESKAPE pathogens confer serious hepato-renal toxicity. The rapid advancement of informatics approaches and literature surge led to the understanding of mechanism of action in more faster and specific manner. Some of the important virulence factors include adhesins, aerobactin system, hemolysin, capsular polysaccharides, biofilm formation, efflux pump, quorum sensing, beta-lactamase enzyme and various surface receptors that need to be targeted by using chemical modeling approaches. Six bacterial representative species of ESKAPE category were analyzed by targeting 05 virulence factors using combinatorial matrix approach. This in silico bioprospection analysis revealed 40 potential herbal leads amongst a database of 300 plants identified using classical bioprospection approach. The model has been validated at in vitro level against Carbapenem Resistant Enterobacteriaceae revealing 02 potent antibiotics (Berberis and Camellia sp.). The antibiotics were standardized using qualitative, quantitative and bioactivity descriptors. © 2017, National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR).

An important use of NGS techniques is to detect the full range of genomic variation which lead to diseases. However, the velocity at which such findings are published sometimes causes latency to exist between the NGS data available to researchers and the latest research that is published. Due to the prevalence of gaps and inconsistencies in the variant analysis process, researchers are facing issues in discriminating disease-associated variations (mutations) from a large number of un-harmful genomic variants. This paper presents a framework to discriminate variants with deleterious effects and to verify such effects using an automated literature search. © 2016 IEEE.","2017","2020-07-30 19:41:34","2020-07-30 19:41:34","2016-09-01","147-154","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Int.

To this end, we carried out a longitudinal analysis (1950–2013), running a generic query (filtered only by year of publication) to minimise the effects of academic search engine optimisation. This gave us a final sample of 64,000 documents (1000 per year). The strong correlation between a document's citations and its position in the search results (r = −0.67) led us to conclude that Google Scholar is able to identify highly-cited papers effectively. This, combined with Google Scholar's unique coverage (no restrictions on document type and source), makes the academic search engine an invaluable tool for bibliometric research relating to the identification of the most influential scientific documents. We find evidence, however, that Google Scholar ranks those documents whose language (or geographical web domain) matches with the user's interface language higher than could be expected based on citations. Nonetheless, this language effect and other factors related to the Google Scholar's operation, i.e. the proper identification of versions and the date of publication, only have an incidental impact. They do not compromise the ability of Google Scholar to identify the highly-cited papers. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","2017","2020-07-30 19:41:34","2020-07-30 19:41:34","","152-163","","1","11","","J.

The availability of social sites, persistent identifiers, and manuscript-sharing sites has simplified the job of increasing the impact of an article. We herein share some of these tricks-of-the-trade. © 2018, Indian Academy of Pediatrics.","2018","2020-07-30 19:41:35","2020-07-30 19:41:35","","49-54","","1","55","","Indian Pediatr.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Springer India","<p>Cited By :1</p>; <p>CODEN: INPDA</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Mishra, D.; Department of Pediatrics, Maulana Azad Medical CollegeIndia; email: drdmishra@gmail.com</p>; <p>Export Date: 30 July 2020</p>; <p>References: Jinha, A.E., Article 50 million: An estimate of the number of scholarly articles in existence (2010) Learned Publishing., 23, pp. 258-263; <br/>Dewan, P., Shah, D., A writer’s dilemma: where to publish and where not to (2016) Indian Pediatr, 53, pp. 141-145. , PID: 26897147;<br/>Jayaprakash, K., Rekha, A.P., Rajendiran, S., Open access journals-A study (2013) IOSR J Human Soc Sci., 8, pp. 7-9;<br/>Mirjana, I., Miloš, R., Vladimir, K., Jovana, V., Computer science and information systems: Publishing an international open access journal in a developing country (2012) Proceedings of the 5th Belgrade International Open Access Conference, pp. 101-112;<br/>Balhara, Y.P.S., Indexed journal: What does it mean (2012) Lung India., 29, p. 193. , PID: 22628945;<br/>Dewan, P., Gupta, P., Writing the title, abstract and introduction: looks matter (2016) Indian Pediatr, 53, pp. 235-241. , PID: 27029687;<br/>Hartley, J., What’s new in abstracts of science articles (2016) J Med Libr Assoc, 104, pp. 235-237. , PID: 27366127;<br/>Ware, M., Universities’ own electronic repositories yet to impact on Open Access (2017) Nature Web Focus;<br/>Zainab, A.N., Open access repositories and journals for visibility: Implications for Malaysian libraries (2010) Malaysian J Libr Inform Sci., 15, pp. 97-119;<br/>Bleda, A.M., Aguillo, I.F., Can a personal website be useful as an information source to assess individual scientists (2013) The case of European highly cited researchers.

In order to do so, a descriptive research was applied with a quantitative approach. A questionnaire was developed, which was sent to postgraduate coordinations throughout the country, so that graduate students and professors could answer it. The results showed that tool preferences tend to vary between those with more resources, the metadatabases (Google Scholar, CAPES Newspaper Portal, etc.), and those of more simplicity (generic search engines, Sci-Hub etc.), but the latter stand out in some aspects, as in the case of search by title of the article. Thus, it was concluded that, given such variety of tools, researchers tend to opt for tools that more quickly and more practically meet their needs, with the minimum of barriers to achieve what is desired, but are still reliable and ensure the relevance of the information retrieved. © 2018 Universidade Federal de Campina Grande.

Fairly enough, these measures are becoming targets for institutions and individual researchers thus triggering new behaviors. As a matter of fact, scientometrics and informetrics systems of all kinds have to separate the grain from the chaff. Among others, fields like information retrieval, network analysis and natural language processing may offer answers to deal with this kind of problems. Through several emblematic case studies (fake researcher, generated papers, paper mills), we show evidences of attempts to game indicators together with automatic ways to detect them (automatic detection of generated papers, errors detection). © Copyright 2018 for the individual papers by the papers' authors.","2018","2020-07-30 19:41:35","2020-07-30 19:41:35","2018-03-26","6-15","","","2080","","","","","","","","CEUR-WS","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: CEUR Workshop Proc.","<p>Cited By :1</p>; <p>Conference code: 135416</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Labbé, C.; Univ.

The proportion of papers that provide taxonomic data in sufficient detail to permit precise validation of taxonomic identifications is vanishingly small: most did not cite identification methods, most did not state whether identified material had been vouchered, and taxon concepts were almost universally absent in non-taxonomic papers. Overall, the combination of all three factors was provided less than 2% of the time and almost two-thirds of all papers provided none of the three. We suggest that journals should modify the templates used by editors and reviewers by overtly including the following questions: Are Order and Family named in the title, abstract or keywords? Are the methods used for identification of all studied taxa stated clearly? Is it clear who did the identifications, are they named and is their contact information and/or institutional affiliation provided? Is the literature whereupon these identifications are based cited appropriately? This would include some reference to as thorough a revisional taxon concept statement as possible, preferably from recent revisions if available. Are exemplars of all focal species (or all sampled individuals) vouchered in a named repository (ideally with contact person name and accession numbers or other means of ready detection)? Accurate and replicable taxonomic identification is the cornerstone of biology, without which entomological research risks becoming irreproducible and thus not scientific. © 2018 The Royal Entomological Society","2018","2020-07-30 19:41:35","2020-07-30 19:41:35","","1-12","","1","11","","Insect Conserv.

The purpose of this paper is to review customer journey terminology and approaches within the research literature prior to 2013, mainly from the fields of design, management, and marketing. Design/methodology/approach: The study was conducted as a systematic literature review. Searches in Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, ACM Digital Library, and ScienceDirect identified 45 papers for the analysis. The papers were analyzed with respect to customer journey terminology and approaches, the relation to customer experience, the referenced background, and the use of visualizations. Findings: Across the reviewed literature, customer journeys are described not only as a means to take the viewpoint of the customer, but also to reach insight into their experiences. A rich and at times incoherent customer journey terminology is analyzed and discussed, as are two emerging customer journey approaches: customer journey mapping (analysis of a service process “as is”) and customer journey proposition (generative activities leading toward a possible service “to be”). Research limitations/implications: The review is limited to analyzing and making claims on research papers that explicitly apply the term customer journey. In most of the reviewed papers, customer journeys are not the main object of interest but are discussed as one of several topics. Practical implications: A nuanced discussion of customer journey terminology and approaches is provided, supporting the practical application of a customer journey perspective. Originality/value: The review contributes a needed common basis for future customer journey research and practice. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2018","2020-07-30 19:41:35","2020-07-30 19:41:35","","196-227","","2","28","","Journal of Service Theory and Practice","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.","<p>Cited By :33</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Følstad, A.; SINTEFNorway; email: asbjorn.folstad@sintef.no</p>; <p>Export Date: 30 July 2020</p>; <p>Funding details: Norges ForskningsrÃ¥d, 235526</p>; <p>Funding text 1: The main part of this work was supported by grant no. 219800 from the Research Council of Norway.

The economic priority of Web related businesses requires a higher rank on Web snippets or product suggestions in order to receive additional customers; furthermore, Web search engines and recommender systems revenue is obtained from advertisements and pay-per-click. This survey paper presents a review of Web Search Engines, Ranking Algorithms, Citation Analysis and Recommender Systems. In addition, Neural networks and Deep Learning are also analyzed including their use in learning relevance and ranking. Finally, this survey paper also introduces the Random Neural Network with its practical applications. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","2018","2020-07-30 19:41:35","2020-07-30 19:41:35","2018-09-06","","700","","868","","","","Intelligent Systems Conference, IntelliSys 2018","","","","Springer Verlag","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Adv.

Effectiveness of TREC algorithms against Web search engines has been compared [74] where tested algorithms were developed with Okapi or Smart based on the term weighting methods (TF-IDF). Web search engines are evaluated against a series of relevance metrics [75, 76]: precision, TREC based mean reciprocal rank (MRR) and the TREC style average precision (TSAP) obtained from double relevance human evaluations for the top 20 Web results displayed.</p>; <p>References: Murugesan, S., Intelligent agents on the internet and web: Applications and prospects (1999) Informatica, 23, p. 3; <br/>Etzioni, O., Weld, D.S., Intelligent agents on the internet: Fact, fiction, and forecast (1995) IEEE Expert Syst, 10 (4), pp. 44-49;<br/>Zacharis, N.Z., Panayiotopoulos, T., A metagenetic algorithm for information filtering and collection from the World Wide Web (2001) Expert Syst, 18 (2), pp. 99-108;<br/>Pazzani, M., Billsus, D., Learning and revising user profiles: The identification of interesting web sites (1997) Mach.

Websites are ordinarily optimized through back links, while individual webpages are optimized through specific keywords. In this paper, we propose a framework based on set of guidelines for keyword research analysis and back links generation. The proposed framework suggests that webpage content should be based on keywords and the site traffic should be monitored through referrals. We argue that if a website has some prevalent and pertinent keywords in its content and title along with a reasonable amount of back links that help watch the website traffic, then we can get better rank for the website in the search results. The framework also emphasizes that proper keyword selection and link building should be taken into account when developers and designers work on a software development project.

However, there is a debate in the scientific Community which index ranks authors in a better way. Current state-of-the-art depicts that these indices are evaluated on imaginary case scenarios and small datasets. Furthermore, these indices are evaluated on different datasets, making it difficult to grasp the contribution and importance of each index over the others. To analyze the individual behavior of each index, these indices should comprehensively be evaluated on some extensive data set. This study emphasizes on the scrutiny of h-index, some of its variants and extensions to rank authors. These indices are evaluated using a comprehensive data set of Civil Engineering field. For the evaluation of results obtained from these indices, first correlation was calculated among indices. There exists weak correlation between various indices, which demonstrates that the author’s rankings acquired from these indices are not identical. Secondly, occurrences of awardees are checked in all ranked lists. The prestigious award winners of four Civil Engineering societies are considered as a benchmark. In top 10% of ranked list, maximum 47% of the awardees were brought by Wu-index. Overall, none of the index succeeded in bringing 100% awardees to the top rankings. Highest number of awardees on top of all ranked lists are found to be from ACI (American Concrete Institute), which shows ACI might be dependent on these indices for its criterion to honor awards. © 2018, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","2018","2020-07-30 19:41:36","2020-07-30 19:41:36","","1107-1127","","3","114","","Scientometrics","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Springer Netherlands","<p>Cited By :8</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Afzal, M.T.; Department of Computer Science, Capital University of Science and TechnologyPakistan; email: mafzal@cust.edu.pk</p>; <p>Export Date: 30 July 2020</p>; <p>References: Afzal, M.T., Maurer, H.A., Expertise recommender system for scientific community (2011) Journal of Universal Computer Science, 17 (11), pp. 1529-1549; <br/>Aguillo, I.F., Is google scholar useful for bibliometrics?

In total, 50 journals were randomly selected from Beall's list of ‘predatory’ journals. Different methods, including WHOIS tracking, were utilized to query basic information about the selected journals, including location and registrant. Then, 300 articles were randomly selected from within selected journals in various scientific fields. Authors of the selected articles were contacted and sent survey questions to complete. A grounded theory qualitative methods approach was used for data collection and analysis. The results demonstrated that most of these journals were located in the developing world, usually Asia or Africa, even when they claimed they were in the USA or UK. Furthermore, four themes emerged after authors’ survey responses were coded, categorized, and sub-categorized. The themes were: social identity threat, unawareness, high pressure, and lack of research proficiency. Scholars in the developing world felt that reputable Western journals might be prejudiced against them and sometimes felt more comfortable publishing in journals from the developing world. Other scholars were unaware of the reputation of the journals in which they published and would not have selected them had they known. However, some scholars said they would still have published in the same journals if their institution recognised them. The pressure to ‘publish or perish’ was another factor influencing many scholars’ decisions to publish in these fast-turnaround journals. In some cases, researchers did not have adequate guidance and felt they lacked the knowledge of research to submit to a more reputable journal. More needs to be done by institutions and reputable journals to make researchers aware of the problem of ‘predatory’ journals. © 2018 The Author(s).

The ranking given to scholarly articles on a search engine's result page is a significant factor in determining its citation rate and audience. A higher Search Engine(SE) rank can help in garnering more reads and possibly more citations for an article, while a lower rank can actually hinder the perceived value of an article from the users' perspective. Hence, searching academic journals and scholarly articles may need special consideration to other factors, beyond the keyword search and context-based querying strategies adopted by most conventional search engines. Academic search engine optimization (ASEO) is a crucial requirement for search engines dealing with scholarly articles. In this paper, we present a specialized, vertical search engine focusing on journal and scholarly article search, that considers context and semantics of the query and articles in computing the overall ranking of publications. Using this, the effectiveness of various ranking algorithms in determining the rank of individual articles was explored and their performance compared. © 2017 IEEE.","2018","2020-07-30 19:41:36","2020-07-30 19:41:36","2017-02-21","1-6","","","2018-April","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Conf.

The methodology of reverse engineering was applied, in which a comparison was made between the Google Scholar ranking and another ranking consisting of only the number of citations received by documents. This investigation was conducted employing four types of searches without the use of keywords: by publication, year, author, and ""cited by"". The results were matched in the four samples with correlation coefficients between the two highest rankings, which exceeded 0.9. The present study demonstrates more clearly than in previous research how citations are the most relevant off-page feature in the ranking of search results on Google Scholar. The other features have minimal influence. This information provides a solid basis for the academic search engine optimization (ASEO) discipline. We also developed a new analysis procedure for isolating off-page features that might be of practical use in forthcoming investigations. © 2018 El Profesional de la Informacion.

Design/methodology/approach: Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI) collaborated with the Google Scholar team to open and share the research outcomes of STEM in Korea worldwide. KoreaScience is a reference-linking platform for open access scientific and technical journals in Korea, operated by KISTI. KISTI worked with the Google Scholar team to embed machine-readable bibliographic metadata into its journal pages and to create an XML Sitemap to help Google find pages on KoreaScience. Findings: As a result of implementation of metadata and creation of an XML Sitemap, the KoreaScience Web pages have noticeably increased the relevance of a search results’ list on Google and Google Scholar. In addition to this, the KoreaScience platform has received an increasing amount of its traffic from around the world. Originality/value: Not much research has sought to understand SEO in the aspect of users and how it may be facilitated in “visible” academic Web environments such as search systems and open access information systems. For this project, the motivation for investigating SEO comes from its association with positive outcomes that range from personal benefits to global rewards, e.g. increased satisfaction in search user experience and, further, academic progress and scientific development by sharing and accessing scientific knowledge in the fast-growing field of STEM. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2018","2020-07-30 19:41:37","2020-07-30 19:41:37","","77-82","","2","46","","Information Discov.

Different search engines use different algorithms to retrieve appropriate web pages. Google uses page rank algorithm to rank pages. Bing has its own proprietary algorithms. Even though algorithms are different these search engines look for certain on page factors in every web page. This paper tries to find the dominant factors which are part of every web page. Majority of search engines always look for these principal factors and the order in which these factors are given weightage differs from one to another. This research work not only captures the governing factors but also tries to validate the selection by means of data analytics.

Various factors can affect citations distribution of journals. Among them, skewness of citations distribution, author self-citation, journal self-citation and recitations (RCs) have been studied. Design/methodology/approach: The present study based on 16 systematically selected journals indexed in Scopus under the subject category “Library and Information Science.” The study was confined to original research and review articles that were published in the selected journals in the year 2011. The temporal citation window from 2011 to 2014 was taken for analysis. Tools like, Scopus author ID, ORCID and author profiles from Google Scholar were used to minimize the error due to homonyms, spelling variances and misspelling in authors’ names. Findings: It is found that citations distribution in majority of the journals under the study is highly skewed and more likely to follow log-normal distribution. The nature of authorship in papers was found to have positive effect on citation counts. Self-citing data show that higher ranked journals have rather less direct impact on total citation counts than their lower counterpart. RCs are also found to be more in top-tier journals. Though the influence of self-citations and RCs were relatively less at individual level on total citations of journals but combined, they can play a dominant role and can affect total citation counts of journals at significant level. Research limitations/implications: The present study is based on Scopus database only. Therefore, citation data can be affected by the inherent limitation of Scopus. Readers are encouraged to further the study by taking into account large sample and tracing citations from an array of citation indexes, such as Web of Science, Google citations, Indian Citation Index, etc. Originality/value: This paper reinforces that the citations received by journals can be affected by the factors selected in this study. Therefore, the study provides better understanding of the role of these selected factors in journal citations. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2019","2020-07-30 19:41:38","2020-07-30 19:41:38","","90-104","","1","71","","Aslib J.

In addition to the challenge of crawling and indexing information within the enormous size and scale of the Internet, e-commerce customers and general Web users should not stay confident that the products suggested or results displayed are either complete or relevant to their search aspirations due to the commercial background of the search service. The economic priority of Web-related businesses requires a higher rank on Web snippets or product suggestions in order to receive additional customers. On the other hand, web search engine and recommender system revenue is obtained from advertisements and pay-per-click. The essential user experience is the self-assurance that the results provided are relevant and exhaustive. This survey paper presents a review of neural networks in Big Data and web search that covers web search engines, ranking algorithms, citation analysis and recommender systems. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) based on neural networks and deep learning in learning relevance and ranking is also analyzed, including its utilization in Big Data analysis and semantic applications. Finally, the random neural network is presented with its practical applications to reasoning approaches for knowledge extraction. © 2018 by the author.

Therefore, researchers at a large comprehensive university conducted several rounds of web searching before and after the creation and modification of faculty authority records. The sample consisted of 24 faculty and the 35 publications associated with their authorities. The researchers searched for the faculty and their publications on the social networking and identity websites directly, and then used Google, Bing, and Google Scholar to record which of the faculty members’ profiles and publications were found within the top 50 results. Faculty with more profiles were more visible in search engine results, and faculty with authority records ranked more highly in Google. Results related to publication discovery and ranking were more inconclusive, but revealed clear differences between search tools. The implications of this exploratory research can support educational efforts about academic identities and scholarly profiles, begin a research agenda, and inform methodological development surrounding the influence of identity records and academic social networking profiles on web visibility. © 2019, © 2019 Rebecca French and Jody Fagan.","2019","2020-07-30 19:41:38","2020-07-30 19:41:38","","156-197","","2","13","","J.

This paper proposes an SVM-based instruction set recognition method(SVM-IBPS). First, the optimal feature list is obtained by the instruction set feature selection method of information gain, and then the SVM-IBPS model is trained by Support Vector Machine and tested in the dataset of 111,918 executable files, which is decompressed and extracted from the embedded device firmware. Finally, a comparative experiment was conducted with Binwalk and SVM-IBPS. The experimental results show that the accuracy of SVM-IBPS on the test dataset is 98.97%, which is 20.7% higher than that of Binwalk, and the time cost is only about one-ninth of it. © 2019 IEEE.","2019","2020-07-30 19:41:39","2020-07-30 19:41:39","2019-05-24","214-218","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

When these individuals have incentives to be classified a certain way, they may behave strategically to influence their outcomes. We develop a model for how strategic agents can invest effort in order to change the outcomes they receive, and we give a tight characterization of when such agents can be incentivized to invest specified forms of effort into improving their outcomes as opposed to ""gaming"" the classifier.

Recently, SEO has also been applied to academic databases and search engines, in a trend that is in constant growth. This new approach, known as academic SEO (ASEO), has generated a field of study with considerable future growth potential due to the impact of open science. The study reported here forms part of this new field of analysis. The ranking of results is a key aspect in any information system since it determines the way in which these results are presented to the user. The aim of this study is to analyze and compare the relevance ranking algorithms employed by various academic platforms to identify the importance of citations received in their algorithms. Specifically, we analyze two search engines and two bibliographic databases: Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic, on the one hand, and Web of Science and Scopus, on the other. A reverse engineering methodology is employed based on the statistical analysis of Spearman's correlation coefficients. The results indicate that the ranking algorithms used by Google Scholar and Microsoft are the two that are most heavily influenced by citations received. Indeed, citation counts are clearly the main SEO factor in these academic search engines. An unexpected finding is that, at certain points in time, Web of Science (WoS) used citations received as a key ranking factor, despite the fact that WoS support documents claim this factor does not intervene. © 2019 by the authors.","2019","2020-07-30 19:41:39","2020-07-30 19:41:39","","","","9","11","","Future Internet","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: MDPI AG","<p>Cited By :4</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Rovira, C.; Department of Communication, Universitat Pompeu FabraSpain; email: cristofol.rovira@upf.edu</p>; <p>Export Date: 30 July 2020</p>; <p>Funding text 1: Funding: This research was funded by the project ""Interactive storytelling and digital visibility in interactive documentary and structured journalism"".

The purpose of this research is to study the extent to which a university's academic excellence is related to the quality of its web presence. In order to achieve this, a method was devised that quantified the website quality and search engine optimization (SEO) performance of the university websites of the top 100 universities in the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) Shanghai list. A variety of tools was employed to measure and test each website and produced a Web quality ranking, an SEO performance ranking, as well as a combined overall web ranking for each one. Comparing these rankings with the ARWU shows that academic excellence is moderately correlated with website quality, but SEO performance is not. Moreover, the overall web ranking also shows a moderate correlation with ARWU which seems to be positively influenced by website quality and negatively by SEO performance. Conclusively, the results of the research indicate that universities place particular emphasis on issues concerning website quality, while the utilization of SEO does not appear to be of equal importance, indicating possible room for improvement in this area. © 2019 by the authors.","2019","2020-07-30 19:41:39","2020-07-30 19:41:39","","","","11","11","","Future Internet","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: MDPI AG","<p>Cited By :2</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Giannakoulopoulos, A.; Department of Audio and Visual Arts, Ionian University, 7 Tsirigoti Square, Greece; email: agiannak@ionio.gr</p>; <p>Export Date: 30 July 2020</p>; <p>References: Mmantsetsa, M., Wells, P.J., Silvia, F., University Rankings: The Many Sides of the Debate (2014) Manag.

Tables and word clouds generated from recurring words expose the centrality of critical events, which appears to support recent contentions about a “crisis-chasing” mode in anthropology today. But it conceals the multivocality of authors’ engagement with current events, while the idiosyncratic words that fill most of the keyword lists and titles in AE disrupt any generalization about anthropology's primary concerns. Therefore, aggregated key words cannot be taken at face value as signposts of relevance in anthropological scholarship. Yet those isolated words are increasingly influential in an era of digitized publishing, which compels scholars to adapt keywords to algorithmic logics of recognition.

The question has been debated during the last two decades, as OA is gaining momentum and becoming an ever more established option. Without coming to a shared position, the literature on the topic has essentially split into two clusters: on the one hand, the studies that endorse the occurrence of an OA citation advantage; on the other hand, the works suggesting that it has a negligible extent, or is due to other confounding factors. The primary aim of this study is not to bring new evidence in favor or against the citation premium supposedly characterizing OA articles. Instead, this work is meant to test a specific hypothesis connected with the OA citation advantage, namely, that OA papers may benefit from higher citations in open indexing databases (e.g., Google Scholar) rather than in selective indexing engines (i.e., Scopus and Web of Science). The empirical findings, although conflicting, show that the hypothesis above is not misplaced since a few confirmatory results are achieved. However, the hypothesized relationship remains controversial, also because of an uncertain boundary between OA and paywall articles. © 2019, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","2019","2020-07-30 19:41:40","2020-07-30 19:41:40","","995-1018","","2","121","","Scientometrics","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Springer Netherlands","<p>Cited By :2</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Copiello, S.; Department of Architecture, IUAV University of Venice, Dorsoduro 2206, Italy; email: sergio.copiello@iuav.it</p>; <p>Export Date: 30 July 2020</p>; <p>References: Aguillo, I.F., Is Google Scholar useful for bibliometrics?

Concurrently, journalists and media professionals need to be aware and possess a new set of skills connected to web technologies, as well as respond to new reading tendencies and information consumption habits. A number of studies have shown that search engines are an important source of the traffic to news websites around the world, identifying the significance of high rankings in search results. Journalists are writing to be read, and that means ensuring that their news content is found, also, by search engines. In this context, this paper represents an exploratory study on the use of search engine optimization (SEO) in news websites. A series of semi-structured, in-depth interviews with professionals at four Greek media organizations uncover trends and address issues, such as how SEO policy is operationalized and applied inside newsrooms, which are the most common optimization practices, as well as the impact on journalism and news content. Today, news publishers have embraced the use of SEO practices, something that is clear also from this study. However, the absence of a distinct SEO culture was evident in newsrooms under study. Finally, according to results, SEO strategy seems to depend on factors, such as ownership and market orientation, editorial priorities or organizational structures. © 2019 by the authors.","2019","2020-07-30 19:41:40","2020-07-30 19:41:40","","","","12","11","","Future Internet","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: MDPI AG","<p>Cited By :1</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Giomelakis, D.; Media Informatics Lab, School of Journalism and Mass Communications, Aristotle University of ThessalonikiGreece; email: dgiomela@gmail.com</p>; <p>Export Date: 30 July 2020</p>; <p>References: Dod, R., (2019) How Social Media Helps SEO [Final Answer].

Other measures of research quality such as citations are now available, and these measures offer a wider perspective of academic contribution beyond simple article counting. Citations now are an important consideration when evaluating research impact and quality. Google Scholar, Scopus, and other programs are readily available to provide citation counts; and other measures such as Hirsch's h-index have also been developed. In this editorial, we discuss the issue of research citation, focusing on strategies that can be used to ensure that one's research output is read by the intended academic and practitioner audiences. We first examine why articles get cited including a consideration of types of articles and types of citations. We then outline how to set up and present research. This includes a discussion of the research's strong contributions to the field; conceptual and theoretical development; compelling findings; and clear conclusions and implications. Third, we provide guidelines to create visibility and understanding of the article's contribution in the offline research community and beyond. Fourth, we examine the critical role of the online environment in creating visibility for an article. Here, after having given an overview of academic search, we discuss keywords; design and structure; graphics; metadata and university research repositories; and interactive social media content. We conclude by cautioning about unethical practices to increase citations. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","2020","2020-07-30 19:41:40","2020-07-30 19:41:40","","","","","","","Ind. Mark.

First, it examines the status of L2 teacher education research vis-à-vis general teacher education. Second, a common stereotype which considers teacher education as a Western phenomenon is challenged. Third, it investigates the extent to which different levels of education have benefited from relevant research. Data obtained from 176 research articles published from 2003 to 2018, showed that teacher education research is expectedly more nested within general education. Nevertheless, it was revealed that whereas general teacher education is more promulgated in Western contexts, L2 teacher education is more based in Asia-pacific contexts. Finally, higher education appears to be left out in both L2 and general teacher education research, as most studies focused on K-12. The results are believed to provide important implications for L2 teacher education researchers and practitioners. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2020","2020-07-30 19:41:41","2020-07-30 19:41:41","","","","","","","Educ.

From a vocabulary of 164 keywords, 290 web queries were built and executed on Google, collecting the first 20 results obtained for each query. The results confirm that the universities obtain a variable web positioning according to the dimension linked to the web query and that the web pages related to teaching (especially Degrees) obtain the best ranks, even when executing web queries oriented to research. However, a low position is observed not only for the UPV, but also for all the Spanish on-site public universities (only a 27% of the Top 20 ranks correspond to these universities). It is concluded that a multilevel analysis is necessary to study the web positioning of the universities and that the proposed model is both viable and scalable. However certain limitations must be taken into account, as the dependence of the vocabulary used and the high variability of data, that must be considered in the design of this type of analysis models. © 2020 CSIC.","2020","2020-07-30 19:41:41","2020-07-30 19:41:41","","1-10","","2","43","","Rev.

This book is innovative in its design and concept since it tackles a frontier topic with an original methodology, combining academic rigor with practical insights. Digital intangibles range from digitized versions of traditional immaterial assets (brands, patents, know-how, etc.) to more trendy applications like big data, Internet of Things, interoperable databases, artificial intelligence, digital newspapers, social networks, blockchains, FinTech applications, etc. This book comprehensively addresses related valuation issues, and demonstrates how best practices can be applied to specific asset appraisals, making it of interest to researchers, students, and practitioners alike. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","2020","2020-07-30 19:41:41","2020-07-30 19:41:41","","","1","","","","","","The Valuation of Digital Intangibles: Technology, Marketing and Internet","","","","Palgrave Macmillan","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: The Valuat. of Digital Intangibles: Technology, Marketing and Internet Pages: 536 Publication Title: The Valuat. of Digital Intangibles: Technology, Marketing and Internet DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-36918-7","<p>Correspondence Address: Visconti, R.M.; Catholic University of the Sacred HeartItaly</p>; <p>Export Date: 30 July 2020</p>; <p>References: Alonso, B.V., Garcia-Merino, J.D., Arregui-Ayastuy, G., Motives for financial valuation of intangibles and business performance in smes (2015) Innovar, 25 (56), pp. 113-128; <br/>Arvidsson, S., Disclosure of non-financial information in the annual report: A management-team perspective (2011) Journal of Intellectual Capital, 12 (2), pp. 277-300;<br/>Bianchi, P., Labory, S., (2017) The Economy Importance of Intangible Assets, , London: Routledge;<br/>Boujelben, S., Fedhila, H., The effects of intangible investments on future ocf (2011) Journal of Intellectual Capital, 12 (4), pp. 480-494;<br/>Clausen, S., Hirth, S., Measuring the value of intangibles (2016) Journal of Corporate Finance, 40, pp. 110-127;<br/>Cohen, A.J., (2005) Intangible Assets: Valuation and Economic Benefit, , Hoboken: Wiley;<br/>Corcoles, Y.R., Towards the convergence of accounting treatment for intangible assets (2010) Intangible Capital, 6 (2), pp. 185-201;<br/>Damodaran, A., (2018) The Dark Side of Valuation, , (3rd ed.).

To study web visibility, a search engine optimization (SEO) tool called Sistrix Toolbox was used. It analyzes a large amount of data, the most notable of which is the visibility index, which combines different data indicators to analyze web visibility. The results are checked with Xovi, another SEO tool that offers its own visibility index. Both tools allow us to observe similar trends in the visibility of library websites. The results show that university library visibility is generally low and that there is no direct correlation between the visibility index of libraries and that of their universities. Some revealing exceptions were identified, in which libraries have made significant contributions to the web visibility of their universities. The results would suggest that higher education institutions need to implement SEO strategies in order to increase their visibility more effectively. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","2020","2020-07-30 19:41:41","2020-07-30 19:41:41","","","","4","46","","J.

Recently, SEO has also been applied to academic databases and search engines, in a trend that is in constant growth. This new approach, known as academic SEO (ASEO), has generated a field of study with considerable future growth potential due to the impact of open science. The study reported here forms part of this new field of analysis. The ranking of results is a key aspect in any information system since it determines the way in which these results are presented to the user. The aim of this study is to analyze and compare the relevance ranking algorithms employed by various academic platforms to identify the importance of citations received in their algorithms. Specifically, we analyze two search engines and two bibliographic databases: Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic, on the one hand, and Web of Science and Scopus, on the other. A reverse engineering methodology is employed based on the statistical analysis of Spearman's correlation coefficients. The results indicate that the ranking algorithms used by Google Scholar and Microsoft are the two that are most heavily influenced by citations received. Indeed, citation counts are clearly the main SEO factor in these academic search engines. An unexpected finding is that, at certain points in time, Web of Science (WoS) used citations received as a key ranking factor, despite the fact that WoS support documents claim this factor does not intervene. © 2019 by the authors.","2019","2020-07-30 19:42:09","2020-07-30 19:42:09","","","","9","11","","Future Internet","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: MDPI AG","<p>Cited By :4</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Rovira, C.; Department of Communication, Universitat Pompeu FabraSpain; email: cristofol.rovira@upf.edu</p>; <p>Export Date: 30 July 2020</p>; <p>Funding text 1: Funding: This research was funded by the project ""Interactive storytelling and digital visibility in interactive documentary and structured journalism"".

From a vocabulary of 164 keywords, 290 web queries were built and executed on Google, collecting the first 20 results obtained for each query. The results confirm that the universities obtain a variable web positioning according to the dimension linked to the web query and that the web pages related to teaching (especially Degrees) obtain the best ranks, even when executing web queries oriented to research. However, a low position is observed not only for the UPV, but also for all the Spanish on-site public universities (only a 27% of the Top 20 ranks correspond to these universities). It is concluded that a multilevel analysis is necessary to study the web positioning of the universities and that the proposed model is both viable and scalable. However certain limitations must be taken into account, as the dependence of the vocabulary used and the high variability of data, that must be considered in the design of this type of analysis models. © 2020 CSIC.","2020","2020-07-30 19:42:09","2020-07-30 19:42:09","","1-10","","2","43","","Rev.

The methodology of reverse engineering was applied, in which a comparison was made between the Google Scholar ranking and another ranking consisting of only the number of citations received by documents. This investigation was conducted employing four types of searches without the use of keywords: by publication, year, author, and ""cited by"". The results were matched in the four samples with correlation coefficients between the two highest rankings, which exceeded 0.9. The present study demonstrates more clearly than in previous research how citations are the most relevant off-page feature in the ranking of search results on Google Scholar. The other features have minimal influence. This information provides a solid basis for the academic search engine optimization (ASEO) discipline. We also developed a new analysis procedure for isolating off-page features that might be of practical use in forthcoming investigations. © 2018 El Profesional de la Informacion.

The applied technique of data collection was surveyed. The sample was composed by journals classified in Scimago Journal & Country Rank (SJR), all of them associated to five subject categories in the Latin American context: Philosophy, Theology, Law, Political Science and Psychology. The main finding was that Web 2.0 tools are underused by the analyzed journals, we could infer that the positioning of a journal is not directly related with the usage of this kind of technological tools. From the results obtained, it is suggested, as a future research line, the identification of other factors that positively affect the visibility of the journals. © 2019, Universidad de Buenos Aires.","2019","2020-07-30 19:42:29","2020-07-30 19:42:29","","131-150","","","40","","Inf.

Recently, SEO has also been applied to academic databases and search engines, in a trend that is in constant growth. This new approach, known as academic SEO (ASEO), has generated a field of study with considerable future growth potential due to the impact of open science. The study reported here forms part of this new field of analysis. The ranking of results is a key aspect in any information system since it determines the way in which these results are presented to the user. The aim of this study is to analyze and compare the relevance ranking algorithms employed by various academic platforms to identify the importance of citations received in their algorithms. Specifically, we analyze two search engines and two bibliographic databases: Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic, on the one hand, and Web of Science and Scopus, on the other. A reverse engineering methodology is employed based on the statistical analysis of Spearman's correlation coefficients. The results indicate that the ranking algorithms used by Google Scholar and Microsoft are the two that are most heavily influenced by citations received. Indeed, citation counts are clearly the main SEO factor in these academic search engines. An unexpected finding is that, at certain points in time, Web of Science (WoS) used citations received as a key ranking factor, despite the fact that WoS support documents claim this factor does not intervene. © 2019 by the authors.","2019","2020-07-30 19:42:29","2020-07-30 19:42:29","","","","9","11","","Future Internet","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: MDPI AG","<p>Cited By :4</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Rovira, C.; Department of Communication, Universitat Pompeu FabraSpain; email: cristofol.rovira@upf.edu</p>; <p>Export Date: 30 July 2020</p>; <p>Funding text 1: Funding: This research was funded by the project ""Interactive storytelling and digital visibility in interactive documentary and structured journalism"".

To study web visibility, a search engine optimization (SEO) tool called Sistrix Toolbox was used. It analyzes a large amount of data, the most notable of which is the visibility index, which combines different data indicators to analyze web visibility. The results are checked with Xovi, another SEO tool that offers its own visibility index. Both tools allow us to observe similar trends in the visibility of library websites. The results show that university library visibility is generally low and that there is no direct correlation between the visibility index of libraries and that of their universities. Some revealing exceptions were identified, in which libraries have made significant contributions to the web visibility of their universities. The results would suggest that higher education institutions need to implement SEO strategies in order to increase their visibility more effectively. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","2020","2020-07-30 19:42:29","2020-07-30 19:42:29","","","","4","46","","J.

To study web visibility, a search engine optimization (SEO) tool called Sistrix Toolbox was used. It analyzes a large amount of data, the most notable of which is the visibility index, which combines different data indicators to analyze web visibility. The results are checked with Xovi, another SEO tool that offers its own visibility index. Both tools allow us to observe similar trends in the visibility of library websites. The results show that university library visibility is generally low and that there is no direct correlation between the visibility index of libraries and that of their universities. Some revealing exceptions were identified, in which libraries have made significant contributions to the web visibility of their universities. The results would suggest that higher education institutions need to implement SEO strategies in order to increase their visibility more effectively.","2020-07","2020-07-30 20:53:14","2020-07-30 20:53:14","","102171","","4","46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000540656600012","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ranking given to scholarly articles on a search engine's result page is a significant factor in determining its citation rate and audience. A higher Search Engine(SE) rank can help in garnering more reads and possibly more citations for an article, while a lower rank can actually hinder the perceived value of an article from the users' perspective. Hence, searching academic journals and scholarly articles may need special consideration to other factors, beyond the keyword search and context-based querying strategies adopted by most conventional search engines. Academic search engine optimization (ASEO) is a crucial requirement for search engines dealing with scholarly articles. In this paper, we present a specialized, vertical search engine focusing on journal and scholarly article search, that considers context and semantics of the query and articles in computing the overall ranking of publications. Using this, the effectiveness of various ranking algorithms in determining the rank of individual articles was explored and their performance compared.","2017","2020-07-30 20:53:14","2020-07-30 20:53:14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publication Title: 2017 Conference on Information and Communication Technology (cict) WOS:000465072300052","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To do this, a query per year was carried out from 1950 to 2013 identifying the top 1,000 documents retrieved from Google Scholar and obtaining a final sample of 64,000 documents, of which 40% provided a free link to full-text. The results obtained show that the average highly-cited document is a journal or book article (62% of the top 1% most cited documents of the sample), written in English (92.5% of all documents) and available online in PDF format (86.0% of all documents). Yet, the existence of errors should be noted, especially when detecting duplicates and linking citations properly. Nonetheless, the fact that the study focused on highly cited papers minimizes the effects of these limitations. Given the high presence of books and, to a lesser extent, of other document types (such as proceedings or reports), the present research concludes that the Google Scholar data offer an original and different vision of the most influential academic documents (measured from the perspective of their citation count), a set composed not only of strictly scientific material (journal articles) but also of academic material in its broadest sense.","2016","2020-07-30 20:54:06","2020-07-31 00:55:45","","1-21","","4","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Library & Information Science Abstracts (LISA)","1854221711","","","Place: Madrid Publisher: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas","<p>Artigo principal do documento - Tables; References; Graphs; Charts</p>; <p>Copyright - Copyright Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas Oct-Dec 2016</p>; <p>Última atualização em - 2018-10-06</p>","","http://link.periodicos.capes.gov.br/sfxlcl41?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Alisa&atitle=A+two-sided+academic+landscape%3A+snapshot+of+highly-cited+documents+in+Google+Scholar+%281950-2013%29%2FUn+panorama+acad%C3%A9mico+de+dos+caras%3A+retrato+de+los+documentos+altamente+citados+en+Google+Scholar+%281950-2013%29&title=Revista+Espanola+de+Documentacion+Cientifica&issn=02100614&date=2016-10-01&volume=39&issue=4&spage=1&au=Mart%C3%ADn-Mart%C3%ADn%2C+Alberto%3BOrduna-Malea%2C+Enrique%3BAyll%C3%B3n%2C+Juan+M%3BL%C3%B3pez-C%C3%B3zar%2C+Emilio+Delgado&isbn=&jtitle=Revista+Espanola+de+Documentacion+Cientifica&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3989%2Fredc.2016.4.1405","Search engines; Citations; Humanities; Bibliometrics; Library And Information Sciences; Bibliographic data bases; Books; Journals; Science; Social sciences; Studies; #aprovado; #google academico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach              - The total number of records and those belonging to the most reputable journals (1,762) and organizations (346) according to the Field Rating indicator in each of the 15 fields and 204 sub-fields of MAS, have been collected and statistically analysed in March 2014, by means of an automated querying process via http, covering academic publications from 1700 to present.              Findings              - MAS has no longer been updated since 2013, although this phenomenon began to be glimpsed in 2011, when its coverage plummeted. Throughout 2014, indexing of new records is still ongoing, but at a minimum rate, without following any apparent pattern.              Research limitations/implications              - There are also retrospective records being indexed at present. In this sense, this research provides a picture of what MAS offered during March 2014 being queried directly via http.              Practical implications              - The unnoticed obsolescence of MAS affects to the quality of the service offered to its users (both those who engage in scientific information seeking and also those who use it for quantitative purposes).              Social implications              - The predominance of Google Scholar (GS) as monopoly in the academic search engines market as well as the prevalence of an open construction model (GS) vs a closed model (MAS).              Originality/value              - A complete longitudinal analysis of disciplines, journals and organizations on MAS has been performed for the first time identifying an unnoticed obsolescence. Any public explanation or disclaimer note has been announced from the responsible company, something incomprehensible given its implications for the reliability and validity of bibliometric data provided on disciplines, journals, authors and congress as well as their fair representation on the academic search engine.","2014","2020-07-30 20:54:06","2020-07-31 00:57:23","","936-953","","7","38","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Library & Information Science Abstracts (LISA)","1633961661","","","Place: Bradford Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","<p>Copyright - © Emerald Group Publishing Limited&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2014</p>; <p>Nome - Google Inc</p>; <p>SubjectsTermNotLitGenreText - United States--US</p>; <p>Última atualização em - 2019-09-06</p>","","http://link.periodicos.capes.gov.br/sfxlcl41?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Alisa&atitle=The+silent+fading+of+an+academic+search+engine%3A+the+case+of+Microsoft+Academic+Search&title=Online+Information+Review&issn=14684527&date=2014-10-01&volume=38&issue=7&spage=936&au=Ordu%C3%B1a-Malea%2C+Enrique%3BMart%C3%ADn-Mart%C3%ADn%2C+Alberto%3BM.+Ayllon%2C+Juan%3BDelgado+L%C3%B3pez-C%C3%B3zar%2C+Emilio&isbn=&jtitle=Online+Information+Review&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2FOIR-07-2014-0169","Search engines; Publications; Bibliometrics; Bibliographic data bases; Journals; Science; 5400:Research & development; 8331:Internet services industry; Computers--Internet; Information science; Internet service providers; United States--US; Web sites; #rejeito; #mba microsoft academic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach - The study applies web analytical tools, such as Alexa.com, in the collection of data about Canadian libraries' visibility performance in the ranking of search engine results. Concepts from the Integrated IS&R Research Framework are applied to analyze SEO as an element within the Framework. Findings - The results show that certain websites' characteristics do have an effect on how well libraries' websites are ranked by search engines. Notably, the reputation of a library's website and the number of its search engine indexed webpages increase its ranking on SERPs as well as the findability of its digital content. Originality/value - Most of the existing works on SEO have been confined to popular literature, outside of scholarly academic research in library and information science. Only few studies with a focus on libraries' application of SEO exist. No known study has applied an empirical approach to the examination of relevant libraries' website characteristics to determine their visibility performance on search engine result pages (SERPs). This study identified several website characteristics that can be optimized for higher SERP rankings. It also analyzed the impact of external links, as well as that of the number of indexed webpages by search engines on higher SERP rankings.","2013","2020-07-30 20:54:06","2020-07-31 00:51:01","","87-108","","1","31","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Library & Information Science Abstracts (LISA)","1302584681","","","Place: Bradford Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","<p>Copyright - Copyright Emerald Group Publishing Limited 2013</p>; <p>Nome - Google Inc</p>; <p>Última atualização em - 2019-09-06</p>","","http://link.periodicos.capes.gov.br/sfxlcl41?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Alisa&atitle=Increasing+libraries%27+content+findability+on+the+web+with+search+engine+optimization&title=Library+Hi+Tech&issn=07378831&date=2013-01-01&volume=31&issue=1&spage=87&au=Onaifo%2C+Daniel%3BRasmussen%2C+Diane&isbn=&jtitle=Library+Hi+Tech&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2F07378831311303958","Internet; Search engines; Information retrieval; Library And Information Sciences--Computer Applications; Studies; 8331:Internet services industry; Web sites; 5200:Communications & information management; 9130:Experimental/theoretical; Libraries; #aprovado; #seo no ambiente informacional","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"9ZPELLU8","journalArticle","2012","Kenning Arlitsch; O'Brien, Patrick S","Invisible institutional repositories: addressing the low indexing ratios of IRs in Google","Library Hi Tech","","07378831","10.1108/07378831211213210","https://search.proquest.com/docview/925975793?accountid=8112","Purpose - Google Scholar has difficulty indexing the contents of institutional repositories, and the authors hypothesize the reason is that most repositories use Dublin Core, which cannot express bibliographic citation information adequately for academic papers. Google Scholar makes specific recommendations for repositories, including the use of publishing industry metadata schemas over Dublin Core. This paper aims to test a theory that transforming metadata schemas in institutional repositories will lead to increased indexing by Google Scholar. Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted two surveys of institutional and disciplinary repositories across the USA, using different methodologies. They also conducted three pilot projects that transformed the metadata of a subset of papers from USpace, the University of Utah's institutional repository, and examined the results of Google Scholar's explicit harvests. Findings - Repositories that use GS recommended metadata schemas and express them in HTML meta tags experienced significantly higher indexing ratios. The ease with which search engine crawlers can navigate a repository also seems to affect indexing ratio. The second and third metadata transformation pilot projects at Utah were successful, ultimately achieving an indexing ratio of greater than 90 percent. Research limitations/implications - The second survey is limited to 40 titles from each of seven repositories, for a total of 280 titles. A larger survey that covers more repositories may be useful. Practical implications - Institutional repositories are achieving significant mass, and the rate of author citations from those repositories may affect university rankings. Lack of visibility in Google Scholar, however, will limit the ability of IRs to play a more significant role in those citation rates. Social implications - Transforming metadata can be a difficult and tedious process. The Institute of Museum and Library Services has recently awarded a National Leadership Grant to the University of Utah to continue SEO research with its partner, OCLC Inc., and to develop a toolkit that will include automated transformation mechanisms. Originality/value - Little or no research has been published about improving the indexing ratio of institutional repositories in Google Scholar. The authors believe that they are the first to address the possibility of transforming IR metadata to improve indexing ratios in Google Scholar.","2012","2020-07-30 20:54:07","2020-07-31 00:50:20","","60-81","","1","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Library & Information Science Abstracts (LISA)","925975793","","","Place: Bradford Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","<p>Copyright - Copyright Emerald Group Publishing Limited 2012</p>; <p>Nome - Google Inc</p>; <p>Última atualização em - 2019-12-20</p>","","http://link.periodicos.capes.gov.br/sfxlcl41?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Alisa&atitle=Invisible+institutional+repositories%3A+addressing+the+low+indexing+ratios+of+IRs+in+Google&title=Library+Hi+Tech&issn=07378831&date=2012-01-01&volume=30&issue=1&spage=60&au=Kenning+Arlitsch%3BO%27Brien%2C+Patrick+S&isbn=&jtitle=Library+Hi+Tech&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2F07378831211213210","Search engines; Academic libraries; Digital libraries; Metadata; Library And Information Sciences--Computer Applications; Studies; 5200:Communications & information management; 9130:Experimental/theoretical; Product development; Ratios; Research & development--R&D; #aprovado","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, the existence of errors should be noted, especially when detecting duplicates and linking citations properly. Nonetheless, the fact that the study focused on highly cited papers minimizes the effects of these limitations. Given the high presence of books and, to a lesser extent, of other document types (such as proceedings or reports), the present research concludes that the Google Scholar data offer an original and different vision of the most influential academic documents (measured from the perspective of their citation count), a set composed not only of strictly scientific material (journal articles) but also of academic material in its broadest sense.","2016","2020-07-30 20:54:20","2020-07-30 20:54:20","","1-21","","4","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Library & Information Science Abstracts (LISA)","1854221711","","","Place: Madrid Publisher: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas","<p>Artigo principal do documento - Tables; References; Graphs; Charts</p>; <p>Copyright - Copyright Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas Oct-Dec 2016</p>; <p>Última atualização em - 2018-10-06</p>","","http://link.periodicos.capes.gov.br/sfxlcl41?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Alisa&atitle=A+two-sided+academic+landscape%3A+snapshot+of+highly-cited+documents+in+Google+Scholar+%281950-2013%29%2FUn+panorama+acad%C3%A9mico+de+dos+caras%3A+retrato+de+los+documentos+altamente+citados+en+Google+Scholar+%281950-2013%29&title=Revista+Espanola+de+Documentacion+Cientifica&issn=02100614&date=2016-10-01&volume=39&issue=4&spage=1&au=Mart%C3%ADn-Mart%C3%ADn%2C+Alberto%3BOrduna-Malea%2C+Enrique%3BAyll%C3%B3n%2C+Juan+M%3BL%C3%B3pez-C%C3%B3zar%2C+Emilio+Delgado&isbn=&jtitle=Revista+Espanola+de+Documentacion+Cientifica&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3989%2Fredc.2016.4.1405","Search engines; Citations; Humanities; Bibliometrics; Library And Information Sciences; Bibliographic data bases; Books; Journals; Science; Social sciences; Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach              - The total number of records and those belonging to the most reputable journals (1,762) and organizations (346) according to the Field Rating indicator in each of the 15 fields and 204 sub-fields of MAS, have been collected and statistically analysed in March 2014, by means of an automated querying process via http, covering academic publications from 1700 to present.              Findings              - MAS has no longer been updated since 2013, although this phenomenon began to be glimpsed in 2011, when its coverage plummeted. Throughout 2014, indexing of new records is still ongoing, but at a minimum rate, without following any apparent pattern.

Design/methodology/approach -              The research described arose from an investigation into the observed phenomenon that pages from accessible websites regularly appear near the top of search engine (such as Google) results, without any deliberate effort having been made through the application of search engine optimization (SEO) techniques to achieve this. The reasons for this phenomenon appear to be found in the numerous similarities and overlapping characteristics between SEO factors and web accessibility guidelines. Context is provided through a review of sources including accessibility standards and relevant SEO studies and the relationship between SEO and web accessibility is described. The particular overlapping factors between the two are identified and the precise nature of the overlaps is explained in greater detail.              Findings -              The available literature provides firm evidence that the overlapping factors not only serve to ensure the accessibility of a website for all users, but are also useful for the optimization of the website's search engine ranking. The research demonstrates that any SEO project undertaken should include, as a prerequisite, the proper design of accessible web content, inasmuch as search engines will interpret the web accessibility achieved as an indicator of quality and will be able to better access and index the resulting web content.              Originality/value -              The present study indicates how developing websites with high visibility in search engine results also makes their content more accessible.","2013","2020-07-30 20:54:21","2020-07-30 20:54:21","","564","","4","37","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Library & Information Science Abstracts (LISA)","1425398162","","","Place: Bradford Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","<p>Copyright - © Emerald Group Publishing Limited 2013</p>; <p>Última atualização em - 2019-09-06</p>","","http://link.periodicos.capes.gov.br/sfxlcl41?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Alisa&atitle=Overlapping+factors+in+search+engine+optimization+and+web+accessibility&title=Online+Information+Review&issn=14684527&date=2013-07-01&volume=37&issue=4&spage=564&au=Moreno%2C+Lourdes%3BMartinez%2C+Paloma&isbn=&jtitle=Online+Information+Review&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2FOIR-04-2012-0063","Search engines; Optimization; Design; Computers--Internet; Web sites; 9130:Experimental/theoretical; 5250:Telecommunications systems & Internet communications; Age; Aging; Computer science; Documentation; False information; Handicapped accessibility; Population; Social responsibility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach - The study applies web analytical tools, such as Alexa.com, in the collection of data about Canadian libraries' visibility performance in the ranking of search engine results. Concepts from the Integrated IS&R Research Framework are applied to analyze SEO as an element within the Framework. Findings - The results show that certain websites' characteristics do have an effect on how well libraries' websites are ranked by search engines. Notably, the reputation of a library's website and the number of its search engine indexed webpages increase its ranking on SERPs as well as the findability of its digital content. Originality/value - Most of the existing works on SEO have been confined to popular literature, outside of scholarly academic research in library and information science. Only few studies with a focus on libraries' application of SEO exist. No known study has applied an empirical approach to the examination of relevant libraries' website characteristics to determine their visibility performance on search engine result pages (SERPs). This study identified several website characteristics that can be optimized for higher SERP rankings. It also analyzed the impact of external links, as well as that of the number of indexed webpages by search engines on higher SERP rankings.","2013","2020-07-30 20:54:21","2020-07-30 20:54:21","","87-108","","1","31","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Library & Information Science Abstracts (LISA)","1302584681","","","Place: Bradford Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","<p>Copyright - Copyright Emerald Group Publishing Limited 2013</p>; <p>Nome - Google Inc</p>; <p>Última atualização em - 2019-09-06</p>","","http://link.periodicos.capes.gov.br/sfxlcl41?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Alisa&atitle=Increasing+libraries%27+content+findability+on+the+web+with+search+engine+optimization&title=Library+Hi+Tech&issn=07378831&date=2013-01-01&volume=31&issue=1&spage=87&au=Onaifo%2C+Daniel%3BRasmussen%2C+Diane&isbn=&jtitle=Library+Hi+Tech&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2F07378831311303958","Internet; Search engines; Information retrieval; Library And Information Sciences--Computer Applications; Studies; 8331:Internet services industry; Web sites; 5200:Communications & information management; 9130:Experimental/theoretical; Libraries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"ELTT5LG4","journalArticle","2012","Kenning Arlitsch; O'Brien, Patrick S","Invisible institutional repositories: addressing the low indexing ratios of IRs in Google","Library Hi Tech","","07378831","10.1108/07378831211213210","https://search.proquest.com/docview/925975793?accountid=8112","Purpose - Google Scholar has difficulty indexing the contents of institutional repositories, and the authors hypothesize the reason is that most repositories use Dublin Core, which cannot express bibliographic citation information adequately for academic papers. Google Scholar makes specific recommendations for repositories, including the use of publishing industry metadata schemas over Dublin Core. This paper aims to test a theory that transforming metadata schemas in institutional repositories will lead to increased indexing by Google Scholar. Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted two surveys of institutional and disciplinary repositories across the USA, using different methodologies. They also conducted three pilot projects that transformed the metadata of a subset of papers from USpace, the University of Utah's institutional repository, and examined the results of Google Scholar's explicit harvests. Findings - Repositories that use GS recommended metadata schemas and express them in HTML meta tags experienced significantly higher indexing ratios. The ease with which search engine crawlers can navigate a repository also seems to affect indexing ratio. The second and third metadata transformation pilot projects at Utah were successful, ultimately achieving an indexing ratio of greater than 90 percent. Research limitations/implications - The second survey is limited to 40 titles from each of seven repositories, for a total of 280 titles. A larger survey that covers more repositories may be useful. Practical implications - Institutional repositories are achieving significant mass, and the rate of author citations from those repositories may affect university rankings. Lack of visibility in Google Scholar, however, will limit the ability of IRs to play a more significant role in those citation rates. Social implications - Transforming metadata can be a difficult and tedious process. The Institute of Museum and Library Services has recently awarded a National Leadership Grant to the University of Utah to continue SEO research with its partner, OCLC Inc., and to develop a toolkit that will include automated transformation mechanisms. Originality/value - Little or no research has been published about improving the indexing ratio of institutional repositories in Google Scholar. The authors believe that they are the first to address the possibility of transforming IR metadata to improve indexing ratios in Google Scholar.","2012","2020-07-30 20:54:21","2020-07-30 20:54:21","","60-81","","1","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Library & Information Science Abstracts (LISA)","925975793","","","Place: Bradford Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","<p>Copyright - Copyright Emerald Group Publishing Limited 2012</p>; <p>Nome - Google Inc</p>; <p>Última atualização em - 2019-12-20</p>","","http://link.periodicos.capes.gov.br/sfxlcl41?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Alisa&atitle=Invisible+institutional+repositories%3A+addressing+the+low+indexing+ratios+of+IRs+in+Google&title=Library+Hi+Tech&issn=07378831&date=2012-01-01&volume=30&issue=1&spage=60&au=Kenning+Arlitsch%3BO%27Brien%2C+Patrick+S&isbn=&jtitle=Library+Hi+Tech&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2F07378831211213210","Search engines; Academic libraries; Digital libraries; Metadata; Library And Information Sciences--Computer Applications; Studies; 5200:Communications & information management; 9130:Experimental/theoretical; Product development; Ratios; Research & development--R&D","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Os resultados mostraram que as preferências de ferramentas tendem a variar entre aquelas com mais recursos, as metabases de dados (Google Acadêmico, Portal de Periódicos CAPES etc.), e aquelas de maior simplicidade (buscadores genéricos, Sci-Hub etc.), porém as últimas se sobressaem em alguns quesitos, como no caso de busca por título do artigo. Assim, concluiu-se que, diante de tanta variedade, os pesquisadores tendem a optar por ferramentas que mais rapidamente e de modo mais prático atendam suas necessidades, com o mínimo de barreiras para se alcançar o que se deseja, mais que ainda assim sejam confiáveis e garantam a relevância da informação recuperada.","2018","2020-07-30 20:54:36","2020-07-30 20:54:36","","","","1","28","","","","","","","","","","Portuguese","","","Library & Information Science Abstracts (LISA)","2212803877","","","Place: João Pessoa Publisher: Universidade Federal da Paraíba - Programa de Pós-Graduação em Ciência da Informação","<p>Copyright - © 2018.

To do this, a query per year was carried out from 1950 to 2013 identifying the top 1,000 documents retrieved from Google Scholar and obtaining a final sample of 64,000 documents, of which 40% provided a free link to full-text. The results obtained show that the average highly-cited document is a journal or book article (62% of the top 1% most cited documents of the sample), written in English (92.5% of all documents) and available online in PDF format (86.0% of all documents). Yet, the existence of errors should be noted, especially when detecting duplicates and linking citations properly. Nonetheless, the fact that the study focused on highly cited papers minimizes the effects of these limitations. Given the high presence of books and, to a lesser extent, of other document types (such as proceedings or reports), the present research concludes that the Google Scholar data offer an original and different vision of the most influential academic documents (measured from the perspective of their citation count), a set composed not only of strictly scientific material (journal articles) but also of academic material in its broadest sense.","2016","2020-07-30 20:54:36","2020-07-30 20:54:36","","1-21","","4","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Library & Information Science Abstracts (LISA)","1854221711","","","Place: Madrid Publisher: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas","<p>Artigo principal do documento - Tables; References; Graphs; Charts</p>; <p>Copyright - Copyright Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas Oct-Dec 2016</p>; <p>Última atualização em - 2018-10-06</p>","","http://link.periodicos.capes.gov.br/sfxlcl41?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Alisa&atitle=A+two-sided+academic+landscape%3A+snapshot+of+highly-cited+documents+in+Google+Scholar+%281950-2013%29%2FUn+panorama+acad%C3%A9mico+de+dos+caras%3A+retrato+de+los+documentos+altamente+citados+en+Google+Scholar+%281950-2013%29&title=Revista+Espanola+de+Documentacion+Cientifica&issn=02100614&date=2016-10-01&volume=39&issue=4&spage=1&au=Mart%C3%ADn-Mart%C3%ADn%2C+Alberto%3BOrduna-Malea%2C+Enrique%3BAyll%C3%B3n%2C+Juan+M%3BL%C3%B3pez-C%C3%B3zar%2C+Emilio+Delgado&isbn=&jtitle=Revista+Espanola+de+Documentacion+Cientifica&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3989%2Fredc.2016.4.1405","Search engines; Citations; Humanities; Bibliometrics; Library And Information Sciences; Bibliographic data bases; Books; Journals; Science; Social sciences; Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach              - The total number of records and those belonging to the most reputable journals (1,762) and organizations (346) according to the Field Rating indicator in each of the 15 fields and 204 sub-fields of MAS, have been collected and statistically analysed in March 2014, by means of an automated querying process via http, covering academic publications from 1700 to present.              Findings              - MAS has no longer been updated since 2013, although this phenomenon began to be glimpsed in 2011, when its coverage plummeted.

Design/methodology/approach -              The research described arose from an investigation into the observed phenomenon that pages from accessible websites regularly appear near the top of search engine (such as Google) results, without any deliberate effort having been made through the application of search engine optimization (SEO) techniques to achieve this. The reasons for this phenomenon appear to be found in the numerous similarities and overlapping characteristics between SEO factors and web accessibility guidelines. Context is provided through a review of sources including accessibility standards and relevant SEO studies and the relationship between SEO and web accessibility is described. The particular overlapping factors between the two are identified and the precise nature of the overlaps is explained in greater detail.              Findings -              The available literature provides firm evidence that the overlapping factors not only serve to ensure the accessibility of a website for all users, but are also useful for the optimization of the website's search engine ranking. The research demonstrates that any SEO project undertaken should include, as a prerequisite, the proper design of accessible web content, inasmuch as search engines will interpret the web accessibility achieved as an indicator of quality and will be able to better access and index the resulting web content.              Originality/value -              The present study indicates how developing websites with high visibility in search engine results also makes their content more accessible.","2013","2020-07-30 20:54:36","2020-07-30 20:54:36","","564","","4","37","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Library & Information Science Abstracts (LISA)","1425398162","","","Place: Bradford Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","<p>Copyright - © Emerald Group Publishing Limited 2013</p>; <p>Última atualização em - 2019-09-06</p>","","http://link.periodicos.capes.gov.br/sfxlcl41?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Alisa&atitle=Overlapping+factors+in+search+engine+optimization+and+web+accessibility&title=Online+Information+Review&issn=14684527&date=2013-07-01&volume=37&issue=4&spage=564&au=Moreno%2C+Lourdes%3BMartinez%2C+Paloma&isbn=&jtitle=Online+Information+Review&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2FOIR-04-2012-0063","Search engines; Optimization; Design; Computers--Internet; Web sites; 9130:Experimental/theoretical; 5250:Telecommunications systems & Internet communications; Age; Aging; Computer science; Documentation; False information; Handicapped accessibility; Population; Social responsibility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach - The study applies web analytical tools, such as Alexa.com, in the collection of data about Canadian libraries' visibility performance in the ranking of search engine results. Concepts from the Integrated IS&R Research Framework are applied to analyze SEO as an element within the Framework. Findings - The results show that certain websites' characteristics do have an effect on how well libraries' websites are ranked by search engines. Notably, the reputation of a library's website and the number of its search engine indexed webpages increase its ranking on SERPs as well as the findability of its digital content. Originality/value - Most of the existing works on SEO have been confined to popular literature, outside of scholarly academic research in library and information science. Only few studies with a focus on libraries' application of SEO exist. No known study has applied an empirical approach to the examination of relevant libraries' website characteristics to determine their visibility performance on search engine result pages (SERPs). This study identified several website characteristics that can be optimized for higher SERP rankings. It also analyzed the impact of external links, as well as that of the number of indexed webpages by search engines on higher SERP rankings.","2013","2020-07-30 20:54:37","2020-07-30 20:54:37","","87-108","","1","31","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Library & Information Science Abstracts (LISA)","1302584681","","","Place: Bradford Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","<p>Copyright - Copyright Emerald Group Publishing Limited 2013</p>; <p>Nome - Google Inc</p>; <p>Última atualização em - 2019-09-06</p>","","http://link.periodicos.capes.gov.br/sfxlcl41?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Alisa&atitle=Increasing+libraries%27+content+findability+on+the+web+with+search+engine+optimization&title=Library+Hi+Tech&issn=07378831&date=2013-01-01&volume=31&issue=1&spage=87&au=Onaifo%2C+Daniel%3BRasmussen%2C+Diane&isbn=&jtitle=Library+Hi+Tech&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2F07378831311303958","Internet; Search engines; Information retrieval; Library And Information Sciences--Computer Applications; Studies; 8331:Internet services industry; Web sites; 5200:Communications & information management; 9130:Experimental/theoretical; Libraries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"PA9AMBYS","journalArticle","2012","Kenning Arlitsch; O'Brien, Patrick S","Invisible institutional repositories: addressing the low indexing ratios of IRs in Google","Library Hi Tech","","07378831","10.1108/07378831211213210","https://search.proquest.com/docview/925975793?accountid=8112","Purpose - Google Scholar has difficulty indexing the contents of institutional repositories, and the authors hypothesize the reason is that most repositories use Dublin Core, which cannot express bibliographic citation information adequately for academic papers. Google Scholar makes specific recommendations for repositories, including the use of publishing industry metadata schemas over Dublin Core. This paper aims to test a theory that transforming metadata schemas in institutional repositories will lead to increased indexing by Google Scholar. Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted two surveys of institutional and disciplinary repositories across the USA, using different methodologies. They also conducted three pilot projects that transformed the metadata of a subset of papers from USpace, the University of Utah's institutional repository, and examined the results of Google Scholar's explicit harvests. Findings - Repositories that use GS recommended metadata schemas and express them in HTML meta tags experienced significantly higher indexing ratios. The ease with which search engine crawlers can navigate a repository also seems to affect indexing ratio. The second and third metadata transformation pilot projects at Utah were successful, ultimately achieving an indexing ratio of greater than 90 percent. Research limitations/implications - The second survey is limited to 40 titles from each of seven repositories, for a total of 280 titles. A larger survey that covers more repositories may be useful. Practical implications - Institutional repositories are achieving significant mass, and the rate of author citations from those repositories may affect university rankings. Lack of visibility in Google Scholar, however, will limit the ability of IRs to play a more significant role in those citation rates. Social implications - Transforming metadata can be a difficult and tedious process. The Institute of Museum and Library Services has recently awarded a National Leadership Grant to the University of Utah to continue SEO research with its partner, OCLC Inc., and to develop a toolkit that will include automated transformation mechanisms. Originality/value - Little or no research has been published about improving the indexing ratio of institutional repositories in Google Scholar. The authors believe that they are the first to address the possibility of transforming IR metadata to improve indexing ratios in Google Scholar.","2012","2020-07-30 20:54:37","2020-07-30 20:54:37","","60-81","","1","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Library & Information Science Abstracts (LISA)","925975793","","","Place: Bradford Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","<p>Copyright - Copyright Emerald Group Publishing Limited 2012</p>; <p>Nome - Google Inc</p>; <p>Última atualização em - 2019-12-20</p>","","http://link.periodicos.capes.gov.br/sfxlcl41?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Alisa&atitle=Invisible+institutional+repositories%3A+addressing+the+low+indexing+ratios+of+IRs+in+Google&title=Library+Hi+Tech&issn=07378831&date=2012-01-01&volume=30&issue=1&spage=60&au=Kenning+Arlitsch%3BO%27Brien%2C+Patrick+S&isbn=&jtitle=Library+Hi+Tech&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2F07378831211213210","Search engines; Academic libraries; Digital libraries; Metadata; Library And Information Sciences--Computer Applications; Studies; 5200:Communications & information management; 9130:Experimental/theoretical; Product development; Ratios; Research & development--R&D","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
